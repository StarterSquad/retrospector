<div class="rich">

  <h2>Project layer</h2>

  <p><b>Project</b> or <b>second layer</b> includes isolated, project modules, which further construct the page:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>registration form,</li>
    <li>login block,</li>
    <li>shopping cart, etc.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>It is recommended to use as many as possible unique <abbr class="small-caps">CSS</abbr> classes in second layer layout; even if current design does not need styling, better practice is to assign unique <abbr class="small-caps">CSS</abbr> class to it. Such approach provides better availability of each separate layout block, which allows easily correct styles, without affecting <abbr class="small-caps">HTML</abbr> structure.</p>
  <p>Each module has to be as isolated as possible â€“ independent interface block, which interacts with the base layer only.</p>
